## What is this?

BAD is a short-range / low-rez / low-altitude trained YOLOv8-nano-segmentation model that only detects people and runs at 640px x 480 px. It's a super basic training run for now.

It's free to use so knock yourself out! Just make sure to follow the Ultralytics terms of service around commercial use (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) since this uses their code for training.

# Does it work?

It's not bad... it's a nano model so it's super fast for your edge devices. I have larger models trained on this dataset but they are not open-source. 
The dataset is mostly eye-level data with some overhead / drone data in there too, for this nano model. This is not meant to be a 100%-drone AI model.
